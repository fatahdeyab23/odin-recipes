        <p>These 5-ingredient breakfast hand pies are a nice change of pace.</p>
        <p>A sheet of frozen puff pastry, filled with typical breakfast fixings, bakes quickly into neat pastry pies that can easily be modified to include what you have on hand.</p>

        <H2>Ingredients</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 sheet puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cooked, drained and crumbled</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil, or to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
            <li>Roll puff pastry out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin or your fingers, roll or pat pastry into a square. Cut pastry vertically into 3 rectangles. Transfer to the prepared parchment.</li>
            <li>Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk with basil, salt, and pepper. Add half the cheese and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add egg mixture to a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir eggs until just combined and cooked through. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Add a scoop of eggs on one side of each puff pastry rectangle. Top eggs with a sprinkle of cheese, then some bacon.</li>
            <li>Carefully lift the other side of pastry rectangle and fold it over the side with filling. Use the back of a fork, press down all around the edges to seal completely. Brush each pie with melted butter. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
